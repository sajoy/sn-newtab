# (working title) All the fries

## what do?
- tallies your new tabs
- gives you virtual fries
    - and trophies (eventually (maybe))


## to do!
- add reset button (clear fry count and type)
- add trophies
    - X fries in an hour
    - reset X times
    - changed type
    - 1000 fries!!!!
- !!!!! WOULD BE SO COOL IF COULD EDIT THE CSS OF THE FRIES TO MAKE THEM LIKE ONION RINGS OR WEDGES!!! ??? maybe???
- should probably refactor and stuff
